#W07D5 Custom Hooks

## Outline

[] Create custom hooks
[] useDocumentTitle
[] useMouseMove (we'll make a test for this)
[] useInput (we'll make a test for this)
[] useLocation
[] useApi
[] useKeyDown


## Rules of Hooks

 1) inside a component (they must be called from within React functions (components or custom hooks))

 2) top level (our hooks cannot be called conditionally)

3?) use the word 'use' for our custom hooks. when we choose useDocumentTitle as our hook name, it enables 
React to provide some additional checks.
