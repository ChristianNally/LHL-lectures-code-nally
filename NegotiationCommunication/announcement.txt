Today we're hosting a breakout session on Negotiation and Communication soft skills.

To be in the right frame of mind, and to get the most out of this session, here's something to bring into 
the session:

What was a circumstance in your life where you were in a situation of conflict? Examples might be 
conversations with a boss about how work needed to be done, or with a romantic partner about making sure 
that the house stays clean. Examples might be very benign and not so emotionally fraught, OR they might be 
highly complex and difficult issues.

If you have an example like that in your mind while we're talking about Negotiation as a principled 
discipline, that will help with the learning.

See you soon! Zoom link to follow.
