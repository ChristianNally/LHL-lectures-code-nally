WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
some slides Can people see the screen share okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Excellent.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
to move my meeting controls because they're

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
under a thing.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:14.000
All right, welcome to the inaugural breakout for negotiation and communication for web developers

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:33.000
web development is kind of famous for being a field where sometimes people skills are lacking right now people make a career of working with machines all the time and finding, maybe even sometimes solace in not having to deal with human beings right as

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
they're writing out recipes and algorithms and getting deep into the tech bits and pieces of things.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I'm here to to bear witness to the fact that some people skills can go a long long way. Yeah, working in computing, and that, in many ways, the field is is lacking for that.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And the extent to which you can onboard some people skills, and some negotiation skills, it's going to very much help you throughout your career, and it's a career long endeavor to get better with these things.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:23.000
It's also a great set of skills to bring, not just to your professional life but also to your personal life into your recreation time and everything that you do.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
When I first got into this stuff.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I was astounded at how much of my world is negotiated.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
How many negotiations are happening, day after day.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Yeah. Chris mentions I got my first job at a web agency from a guy I met at a house party. yep, just communicating with people, networking. Right.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I mean, my own personal story and this is.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I was working at McDonald's Detwiler a space industry, large company.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And they had a thing called MDAU and McDonald that Weiler University right there teaching their employees, how to do various things and Getting to Yes, the the book that I'll be using for today's presentation was reading for that bit of schooling and

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:35.000
at the time I was going through some pretty difficult situation with regard to my wife, at the time, and I'm as I'm reading through this book and understanding communication and negotiation better, the tagline for the book that will be using is negotiating

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000
agreement without giving in right in that relationship I very much felt

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:58.000
that I was giving into demands and giving into demand and giving into demands constantly one after the other and that this actually provided a recipe for me to stand my ground on the one hand, but not be a jerk about it on the other hand.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Right.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And so, let's dig into this you'll see a little bit more of this about what it's all about. And, and how it can be useful in so many areas in your, in your world.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:31.000
So, just as with coding, where we learn frameworks and best practices to get a step ahead to gain on the experience that have come from people before us.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Just as it is with computer programming.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:43.000
We can learn frameworks and best practices in these topics of negotiating and communicating.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And from these frameworks and best practices, just become aware of options that we might not have thought about or take paths that are going to reduce friction and in arriving at optimal places.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Right.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.000
So, This book is is pushing 30 years old now.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And when it was first released, and written.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:25.000
They identified early on that there were shifts in the way that society was running that society was happening, that the that the collective consciousness of people was moving and changing.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Right.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Broadly speaking, people are moving away from hierarchy.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Organizations are flatter than they used to be.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:48.000
There's a lot of distrust of expertise, I'm sure you'll notice that in the headlines in the news these days right people are very much carving out their own paths.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And often to do that well involves negotiation and more negotiated things as we go.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
People are less likely to accept authority.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:11.000
people want and deserve an increased stake in the outcomes of their invested time, right, power to individuals here.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And yet at the same time in the world consolidated power is more common than ever before, especially in the world of the hyper efficient digital world that you may be faced with consolidated power in your world.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
There are negotiation opportunities everywhere.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And I hope that some of what we do today is going to open up your eyes to this. But more importantly, you're about to embark on a final project with a couple of other people in your final project.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And a lot of the skills and tips and tricks and ideas that I'll be presenting here are going to be completely useful when it comes to getting along with your group mates in your final script, right, resting on some best practices for communication, some

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000
ideas about how to get past an impasse.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:18.000
So, the next four slides are basically a summary of that book. Getting to Yes.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:42.000
That book was written by a group of people from the Harvard negotiation project, and was the tech, the tips and tricks and techniques were based on a larger research project into the kinds of outcomes that resulted from a variety of kinds of negotiation,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:54.000
and the overall goal is to arrive at better outcomes more efficiently, while preserving the relationships of the parties involved.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
So that you don't leave people feeling with resentment.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And that you don't spin your wheels and land on a non optimal solution.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
For some reason.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And the first step is to become aware of a thing called positional bargaining. Right. This is very much like the traditional haggling that's done over say price.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And what the technique says is

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:31.000
to do your very best not to get suckered into a tug of war over individual parameters.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:44.000
For example, here's Alf and Bert, having a chat, trying to figure out if this job is going to work out says I charge 85 an hour, Bert says I'll pay 50 an hour.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
I mean, even the grammar of it.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I pay 15 hours, it's very final, that's the end of it, it's a position that they've each taken one in 85 and one at 50.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Alpha response that's ridiculous 75 an hour is my final offer right you can see what what traditionally goes on is there's a bit of a back and forth with the hope that somewhere they'll meet in the middle.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And that somehow that middle ground will end up being fair.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:26.000
The problem is that every time a person gives up on a position, and has to argue for a new position.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:34.000
All of their previous defenses for a previously held position, are now being considered invalid in some way.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And you know the person loses face the person's ego is taking hits this back and forth is damaging to relationships. It's damaging to reason that's brought to a negotiation.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:59.000
So we're going to try to take different approaches to this.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:07.000
One of the things that they want us to do straight away, is to separate the people from the problem that you're working on.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:22.000
So for this picture an infographic here for example, the thing that I'm focused on is the fact that we have four people at a table, and they're talking about the thing they're talking about the object of of what they're trying to do, they're talking about

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:33.000
the machine they're trying to build. In our case the software that we're trying to build. Right. It's about that thing. it's not about the individuals.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And as you work in companies and as you work for people and as you work with other people and on teams, you'll start to recognize when people are laser focused on the outcomes that you're trying to work on together, as opposed to making it about the people

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
like look at Alvin Burke here.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:15.000
That's ridiculous. 75, an hour is my final offer Burt Stop being silly right there, including phrases that are about the other person, not about the essence of of what's going on in this trading of ideas back and forth and changing of positions and whatnot.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:23.000
So instead of positional bargaining. The technique says, focus on interests, not on positions.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Right. So, Burt might have in the back of their mind.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:39.000
I have a limited budget and need money to grow my business, not just for this contract but I need to reserve money so that I'm able to afford so many other things.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Right, that's fine, that's a legitimate interest for Bert to have as the owner of a business who needs some work done.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Alf on the other hand, needs to have their time compensated for fairly. Right, which in and of itself is an entirely valid interest.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Right.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Bert would agree that Alf needs to have their time compensated for fairly, they may not agree about what fair means.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:27.000
But that's okay. They can each make these statements, and those statements, enter into the conversation as pillars upon which the framework for agreement might happen, right.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:45.000
So, every time you hear in a negotiation, somebody taking a position, encourage yourself to do this. Try to tease out what is the underlying interest in the position that they've taken.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And the more complex the thing that you are negotiating over the more complex that relationship is going to be the relationship between positions and interests.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Right.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Some interests are very legitimate interest, other interests are not as legitimate.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And then you start getting into discussions about the nature of the interests.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:19.000
You can see that this is going to inform the kinds of conversations that you're going to be having in the middle of a negotiation. Yeah.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Um, any questions that you've seen it from what you've seen so far.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Any questions that you've seen it from what you've seen so far. How about examples, I'd like to stop at this moment and just get everybody to think for a little bit about examples of a negotiation that they've been involved in their own life lately.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Yeah.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Now all the better if you're willing to share it with us in the room, two options for sharing one would be to just type an example, into the chat.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:00.000
And another thing you could do if you're feeling up to it is just to turn off your microphone and then let us know.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Can you think of an example of a negotiation that you've been in recently that you're willing to share with us.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:21.000
I will bring an example to what we're talking about today. Straight from boot camp.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And so for the example that I want to bring.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:39.000
We had a case recently where finalists group kind of imploded where there were disagreements over design of the project.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And it turned out that one of the members was of an experience designer.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:58.000
And on the other hand, one of the members was decidedly against the aesthetic that had been chosen for the project.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And so the conversation went in circles for a long time.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Here's an interesting thing.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Everybody wants to have a fair agreement.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
By the end of the negotiation.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:19.000
But what fair means is often very different.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Right. What does fair mean. So, in the context of boot camp finals projects for example, where you have one person who's actually a professional designer.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:37.000
You might think that it makes sense for that person to be the one who gets to say what happens.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Right. That seems fair.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Except that would ignore the legitimate interest of the other party who is there to practice learning some design.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Now, last Labs is not a design Bootcamp, and the design is actually not core to the thing.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Right. And yet, it's very important for a final project.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:13.000
That's the example, that's an example of a kind of disagreement that can need negotiation, where,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:25.000
rather than adopting a position, about I don't think what you're saying should be seen as valid for this design I think instead that I should be able to say what is valid for this design.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Okay, those are positions about who's going to pick a thing.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:41.000
But maybe there needs to be a conversation about what the individual interests of the people are in the way that you proceed. Right.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Okay.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:16:04.000
So the other thing about positional bargaining is that it's on a very defined path, right, you've got a very linear. On the left hand side of a line you've got one extreme on the right hand side of the line, you've got another extreme, and you're staying

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
on that line and you're trying to find a solution.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Only on that line without any other creativity or other factors being brought in that may very much help.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Getting to an agreement. In the end, for example, if the parties involved are willing to sit down and spend some time coming up with creative alternatives that are not

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:58.000
solutions that may satisfy both parties, and may satisfy both parties, better then any tug of war would have resulted in. For example, Burt might say, I could split some future revenue.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:13.000
We could make an agreement about future ownership of the company or future profits or profit share something like that, if Burt happens to lack cash that could be of interest to alpha, alpha could say, because they were mostly interested in having their

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:27.000
time being compensated for fairly if that was their main underlying interests, they could say, I could act as an advisor for a few hours a week maybe alphas particularly senior knowledgeable and Bert needs that kind of information that kind of influence

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
in their company. Right.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:48.000
And so these are ideas and alternatives that have gotten these two negotiators off of their tug of war and into the area of more creative mutual gain ideas.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Okay.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Additional and separate to all of that.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:09.000
It helps to seek and include objective criteria as the way by which decisions get made, rather than it being a tug of war.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Instead, if both people in a negotiation can find an objective criteria and point to it as being a best practice.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:28.000
All the better. Right now I've tried to pick out some examples that are relevant specifically to the world of computer programming.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Right.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000
If you're going to be working on a team, you often makes sense to adopt a style guide.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:43.000
And I mean literally like a written style guide I've got a link here to one by Google for JavaScript.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
The Google JavaScript style guide. And so, as the code is written.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:58.000
If there are discrepancies between the two ways of coding. Let's use the style guide as a way of deciding how we're going to do this. If both parties can agree.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Yeah, it makes sense to code to that particular style guide, then you'll have answers to this.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
You may not think that this is all that important.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:19.000
And yet, if you're going to be doing, pull requests to bring code into a main branch of a project that you're working on.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:37.000
It's going to cut down tremendously. On the amount on the risk of conflict. Merge conflicts between branches. If you've got different lens settings on the two editors, and someone puts stuff up onto a branch and says yes yeah, we need to bring this over

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:50.000
to the main branch. Okay, here's your pull request. Oh, wait a minute, this collides with all the other stuff and the only change is that this isn't camel case and this is not this is not worth my time, and yet that you know it's going to go back and

00:19:50.000 --> 00:20:01.000
forth between the two editors, it's going to cause friction right by pointing to this objective third party standard that can be avoided. Yeah.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Similarly with World Wide Web Standards. This one's an interesting one.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:20.000
It's about a standard for documentation. What, what should be the format and approach of typical documentation. If you can all point to that and say yeah, we agree that that's a good one.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:28.000
We're going to aim for that, then it can solve some disagreements. This one is, is a law.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:36.000
You're speaking of things that that try to be objective and that they are a third party industry standard.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:44.000
This is a law around accessibility standards in Ontario.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Turns out it's one of the more fleshed out ones in Canada. Right. And so if you're building a web project, and you're deciding the scope of what counts says acceptable.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Right. then a document like this can tell you yeah we need to have these attributes we need to do this. That's going to take this much effort to reach this standard.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Right.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:13.000
And so, that may affect if you're going to require that the work be up to standard.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:35.000
then that may mean that you need to because of a budget constraint, not build the rest of the project not build this stretch goal or that stretch goal, but instead focus on meeting this standard, which, you know, has implications in law.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Alright.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Another one of the topics in this book that is worth coming to grips with

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:54.000
is knowing when to step away from the negotiation.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:02.000
And knowing when to to shut down a negotiation and not continue with it. Right.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:12.000
This is especially important when it comes to not giving in and building resentment, after the fact.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Right.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000
I'm using an acronym here that comes straight out of the book it's called BATNA.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:27.000
It stands for best alternative to a negotiated agreement.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:40.000
So, imagine for example that you're in a case where you're in salary negotiations for a position.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Going into those salary negotiations, where you have a certain that they use it as a word of BATNA right it what are your alternatives to a negotiated agreement.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000
If you get no agreement at all about this.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:06.000
And you have some other job that pays a little less but it's going to be important for you to have at least that amount of pay.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Then, you don't need to work extra hard to obtain an agreement.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Because you have that alternative.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
As a fallback option.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Say, right.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Whereas if you yourself know that your own alternative to a negotiated agreement is nowhere near worth what this new position would be.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Then, it sets the very scale of what it is to sacrifice, any given an interest of yours.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:54.000
In exchange for the other good things that would come with that position right now.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:00.000
If there's a tremendous power imbalance between you and a negotiation partner.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:21.000
You may be able to see more clearly. When you think very clearly about what your alternatives are personally, how hard you need to work in order to try to find alternatives that can work for both parties, both parties have legitimate interest legitimate

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:30.000
interests are the easiest ones to defend by referring to third party standards. Right.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
All of that takes work.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:45.000
All of that takes clear thinking, and sometimes you need to step away and then do some soul searching about what your own legitimate interests actually are.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Which things that you would consider your non negotiable. For example, Right.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:25:03.000
And having those things clearly in your mind. In fact, articulating them in an authentic and earnest and open way is going to build trust is going to get you to a certain place, right.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:20.000
It will allow you to fish for creative thinking on the part of the other people that are involved in negotiation, to look for, win, win situations that are outside of the standard kinds of negotiation bits that you're looking at.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:39.000
In the world of employment, it might be flexible work schedule source or stock options or, you know, benefit packages or other things that can be part of the way that a final working agreement can work well.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Even though it may not include hourly wage that's, you know, to some other standard that you've decided to relax on.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:26:02.000
But by knowing your own best alternative to a negotiated agreement that actually sets the scale for how much work you yourself as an individual should be doing when it comes to looking for alternatives.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:14.000
Okay, so here's a really interesting aspect of this approach to negotiating and communicating.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Traditional negotiations can often be conducted in a way where you keep your own interests secret.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:33.000
And you're not sharing your interests with your negotiating partner.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:43.000
That does nothing for building trust, and just being plain and simple and straightforward about the kinds of things that you're communicating about right.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:27:01.000
It turns out that if what you're interested in, is efficiently and amicably arriving at a very optimal solution to a given disagreement or negotiation situation.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:09.000
You can actually share the strategies that you are you yourself are using with the other person.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:19.000
And then they will see you as being open, honest, trustworthy plain, transparent, right, all of those sorts of things.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:27.000
And you can recommend the method to your negotiating partner you can say, Have a look at this.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Prescription this recipe for arriving at good agreements, right, we can agree on what the character of a good agreement is right, it's fair to both parties fair by some definition that we'll talk about in detail is not an agreement that's going to leave

00:27:45.000 --> 00:28:08.000
resentment for either party. right, you can actually agree on those aspects of how the negotiations going to be arrived at and build up a practice around this with people, where you get a certain amount of time with someone, if something's really important

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000
to you.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Fear not, plow into having discussions about that thing to learn about their perspective to learn about you know what their interests are and and how they're able to build more interesting and better agreements and arrangements for you.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Yeah.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Is any of this speaking to people's individual examples of negotiation that they've been in.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Can you think of a circumstance where you made an agreement with somebody and then were immediately resentful but just kept quiet about it and sold it on.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Right.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Would there have been times when going a little more slowly and carefully and being open about what your own self interests were and figuring out how legitimate they were and, and how objective Lee reasonable they are and that would have helped that would

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:18.000
have helped the creative thinking process for finding solutions can be hard work, but the more you practice it the more the more you'll get better at these things they're a skill for sure.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:24.000
If you're open to this stuff, you will start to see negotiation happening all around you.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:39.000
It's like, it's one of these things it's happening multiple times a day with people in your world, your family, friends, your co workers, right. It happens all the time, and people are not aware of it, they're just like negotiations are flying by they're

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
happening so often, right.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
I'm.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:51.000
I'm here to encourage you to start to see those negotiations happening to practice.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:30:01.000
In these situations, trying to identify what are the what are the legitimate interests of the people that I'm speaking with.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Are they even able to articulate those interests themselves. Right. Have I fallen into a trap of getting into a tug of war with somebody over one particular number or instead.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:25.000
Could I be thinking of more creative solutions that satisfy the underlying and unspoken legitimate interests.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Right.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:47.000
Okay. So, communication, obviously, is an underlying skill set that is a ubiquitous so much communicating going on, not all communication is negotiation, obviously.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:54.000
But negotiating well does require communicating well. Right.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:02.000
In the same way that doing group work and a final project requires good communication. There's something here to be practiced. There's something here to be aware of.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Yeah.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Um, who here was at my command line tips and tricks breakout early on in the boot camp. I before you get out of this program, go back to it if you haven't seen it.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Here's a similar principle that I used from that command line tips and tricks thing, slow down to speed up.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000
If you're methodically careful about what you're doing.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:38.000
That is a route to efficiency, where you won't get trapped on some hamster wheel.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.000
Right. And so when it comes to communication,

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000
who has, who is guilty of this, right.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:32:06.000
While you're listening to somebody, especially in, say, a heated emotionally difficult negotiation say that as somebody speaking, you are yourself already formulating a response in the middle of them speaking, who has done that before.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
It was guilty of that problem, right, I know that I am have been, and I'm you know it's the kind of thing that I work on a lot.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:20.000
that problem, right, I know that I am have been, and I'm you know it's the kind of thing that I work on a lot. The mind is an interesting thing right when your mind is on autopilot.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:27.000
It can be extremely fast and extremely self serving.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Right.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:45.000
It takes effort to get yourself out of that habit, and to instead. work on active listening active understanding articulating the positions of the person that you're negotiating with.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
Right.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:55.000
repeating what they've said in your own words to confirm that you understand what they are saying.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:14.000
When you do that, you're effectively creating a bridge to that person you're inviting them to behave in thinking the same way. Right, so that when you speak, you are understood, and they will get on this, this train of articulating what you're saying

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:23.000
and developing a true understanding of each of your interests. Right. Those are good communication skills

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:33.000
pauses are good, you know, whether it's a short pause in the conversation just to think about something that was very profound that just happened.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:50.000
Or, it's a hey let's take a break. Let's go get some lunch, let's just, you know, get out of this situation so that we can think sleep on it for a bit, maybe you want to start a particularly tough negotiation, day by saying, no matter what happens, we're

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:58.000
not going to make any decisions today about the final outcome. Today is all about generating creative solutions.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Yeah.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:13.000
And then you know you got this whole evening and then a chance to sleep on something before coming back to it right, obviously, for more complex things maybe it's going to take more than just today right but you want to make progress toward describing

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000
each other's legitimate interests.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Another panel on some communication tips. And this is also straight out of the book.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000
Go soft on the people but hard on the issues.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:37.000
Right. This is where you can gain some power in negotiation, without being a jerk about it.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Right. The idea here is to separate the people from the problem.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:35:03.000
It is to be perhaps for example, especially ambitious about, say, stretch goals in the finals project. Yeah, I'm really attached to this stretch goal and this stretch goal and the stretch goal I think they're all super important.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:10.000
I want to discover ways that we can be extra efficient and fast.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Because those are very important to me personally, say, compared with.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000
There are other ways of doing things where we don't get to as many stretch goals.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:40.000
Right, even like the choice of which stack you're going to use, right, it's something to be negotiated between people, and it pays to recognize that people may have legitimate interests around some other stack choice, but is that going to slow you down.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:57.000
Right. You can see how it would take some conversation, some understanding of where people are coming from of the skill sets that happened to be president of the end goal of people, remember we're in the final kickoff we were talking about.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:06.000
It's possible to have a successful project, but you haven't achieved your own personal goals. Right. these things do take communication.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Yeah.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:13.000
Another point on separating the people from the issues.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Try consciously choosing the passive voice about things.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:25.000
Right. This is done in in science labs where historically.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:44.000
It's been philosophically extremely important that bias be removed from a situation that the human influence actually be abstracted away. Right, so you would practice this when you're writing, like experiment lab projects right, the beaker was filled

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:52.000
with blah water this much, that right, there's no people in it, it's like the objects and this was happening, right.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:58.000
I'm in the context of a web development project it might be

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:10.000
this web system should have the ability to x y Zed for accessibility reasons.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:20.000
Right. We have this much budget, we should distribute our budget across these needs. Yeah.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:35.000
As opposed to, I think that we should do this and I think you should do that right, those are like active imperative kinds of statements, even your language is already making it about the people.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000
Right.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:43.000
Better to split the people out and talk about the individual bits and pieces.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:53.000
Okay, this whole experience is very much a multi track mega kind of thing.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000
Right.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:02.000
You can communicate about the merits of the case you can communicate about the individual pieces.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:08.000
You can also communicate about how you're communicating.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000
Right.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000
You can negotiate the finer points about the individual interests.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:35.000
But you can also negotiate about how and when you're going to be negotiated, which things count as negotiation and which things are just a chance to get on the same page about things in in lighter ways, right.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000
There's the thing itself.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:45.000
And then there's the tug of war that you want to avoid about the process around the thing itself.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:53.000
And both of these things can be going on simultaneously, right, you can see how how complex this can get.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:04.000
And why it does become a lifelong ambition to get better with these things and tips and tricks.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Okay that's quarter past two o'clock.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:24.000
These techniques might save you. I can think of a few finalists projects that I've been involved in supporting over the last year or so, where things decidedly did go off the rails, right where there were real problems where people came back to us at

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:36.000
lighthouse. The staff the student support coordinators the instructors the mentors, came to us too late, saying, we haven't heard from so and so for three days, what's the problem help.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:36.000
Right.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:42.000
And so they needed help and communicating,

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:50.000
give this a shot, give this set of communicating with this project.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:40:10.000
Give it your best, but then think back through these suggestions of going super easy and super extra supportive on the people that are there, but at the same time, reserving the right to be able to express your own interests that in, In all likelihood

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.000
of the other people that you are communicating and doing group work with would agree is a legitimate interest.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:25.000
the other people that you are communicating and doing group works with would agree is a legitimate interest. Yeah, and that way you'll be able to efficiently arrive at good solutions for everybody.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:49.000
Thank you very much, do reach out to me with examples of these kinds of things that you're running into. I'm super keen to hear stories about how you may have hit a wall, and then took a step back and thought, aha, okay, how is this done best.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:59.000
Can I bring that tool to this circumstance. And can we get past a disagreement and arrive at a creative solution that works for everybody involved.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.000
Yeah.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:07.000
All right, you know what with that let's leave it with, you know, I've got an extra 1015 minutes for questions.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:16.000
And other than that we'll let folks go and feel free to hang around. We'll have a conversation, maybe about some examples.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:26.000
Other than that. Good luck with your finals projects, use good communication skills good negotiation skills. Just as a quick review.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000
This was.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.000
Don't bargain over positions don't get stuck in a tug of war.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Separate the people from the problem.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:55.000
Focus on interests, not positions, find the underlying interests and talk about those look for a Venn diagram of Win Win situations where both people's interests are met, and be creative.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:08.000
Take some time to invent options that satisfy all the interests right you're looking for this area in here, where all the interests are satisfied.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:29.000
And then seek objective criteria as ways of breaking ties. You know, so that people feel good about the fact that the path it's been taken is at least has worked for others in the path in the past.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000
It's going to give you some power

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:46.000
and share these techniques with everybody that you're working with.
