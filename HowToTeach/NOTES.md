0) It helps to think of yourself as competing with Google. At any given moment, a student can Google a 
question and get an excellent answer in no time flat. The thing that Google can't provide is the right 
piece of knowledge at the right time but crucially embedded within a larger context of a longer thread of 
learning. What you bring to LHL students must be accurate and timely, but also firmly rooted in the 
tragectory of the longer student experience.

1) Your lectures will be constantly judged by several different student persona simultaneously. The most 
successful lectures will give all types of learner what they need.

2) Be explicit with yourself about each of the persona you are designing your lecture.
(e.g. beginner & advanced, abstract/theory driven & example/experience driven, etc.)

3) For most learning objectives, always get straight to the point, quickly, so that you can repeat it from 
scratch in a different way later, as required. There isn't time for anything else.

4) Use this overall form:
  a) say what you're going to say
  b) say it
  c) say what you said

and Infuse Russell's Triplet: a) romance, b) detail, c) generalization

So... 

a) say what you're going to say, and say/show how awesome it will be when the student can achieve the 
learning outcome.

b)
  1) teach the theory
  2) show the example
  3) get VERY detailed
  4) tell people how to learn / practice that particular thing.

c) Say what you said, but this time generalize the new knowledge with examples of how that knowledge will 
work into other areas of the tech, and the boundaries between the new tech and other tech.

General Things To Look Out For
------------------------------

5) Always give the students something useful to look at while they're zoning out. Context / Headings / 
Details. Even the 10 minute break can be a set of summary slides.

6) Flicking back and forth between two windows isn't good. Better to show two views simultaneously and let 
the students eyes flick back and forth on their own, rather than flash between windows at them in real 
time. For instance, it is better to put both code and output in one view, so that the thing the student 
happens to be focused on in that moment is not interrupted when you need to flip between them yourself. 
That's annoying to them. It would be better if we just gave them notes in optimized form. "Slides" should 
be a click away. They should have the notes URL in advance so they can click back and forth themselves 
before, during and after lecture.

7) "Only Interupt Students Eyes with a Punchline, and the next/associated learning resource." Flip to the 
next portion of the presentation to forcefully change what they're thinking.

8) The resources I am filling in for each Learning Objective are:

 a) 'context' (position on the 'one slide to rule them all')
 b) 'abstract' (state the Learning Objective explicitly, in the form of a defintion)
 c) 'info graphic' (a diagram that illustrates the point)
 d) 'by example' (code, live or an associated gist)
 e) 'reference' (link to MDN or similar documentation)

Ideally, these resources would...

... be laid out in a fashion that's similar from lecture to lecture
(to limit effort required in learning how to read them)

... have colour syntax highlighting to match VS Code. Live Share in VS Code optimizes screen real estate.

... be available on a website with deep linking, (glossary, dictionary, index, etc.)
