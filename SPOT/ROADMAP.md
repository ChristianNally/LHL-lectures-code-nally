Features Roadmap for SPOT
-------------------------

0) Automatically include the 'coffee vs. naan' question in all Days. (play precedes innovation!) which will 
provide a single place to edit when new break-videos come online.

1) automatically output config files for ImageMagik generated OBS overlays to switch between during lectures

2) Keep data recorded for student 'understanding' values, so that we can compare approaches to teaching OBJs.

3) build a UI so that students can make (and print / output PDF) quizzes and cheatsheets that will help for 
TI prep sessions.

4) Can a multipage express version of the code be maintained alongside a React only SPA front-end? Perhaps 
one is for admin (the express one) vs. the other is for students?

5) A reports section that can display accumulated understanding data.

6) Continue entering OBJs because the system is only ultimately as good as the OBJs in it.

7) Give other instructors accounts, find a permanent home (subdomain) for the app, so that people can link 
to it to find out how students felt about the previous day's OBJs, no matter who is teaching which lecture.
