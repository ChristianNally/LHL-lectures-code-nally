M1 Vs Vagrant
--------------
Everyone has different machines. Some of you are running different OS
on those machines, and some machines are even different architecture.

Some of you have vagrant installed, some of you do not. This is totally fine!
Please be aware of instructions that say "For M1" or "For Vagrant", and only do
it for the appropriate machine.
