$> command filename

# But what is the commandline REALLY?

Really, it's a way to interact with the files on your computer. Even "commands" are files.

You can see that by typing 'which <command>' which will tell you which executable file is being run when 
you execute a given command.

# How can I get help on a given command?

Try 'man <command>' for usage, documentation and a list of options.

e.g. 

$> man ls
